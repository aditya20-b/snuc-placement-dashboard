## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Student Model
- **Personal Info**: Name, Roll Number (unique), Email, Mobile
- **Academic**: Department, Batch, Section, CGPA, Arrears (history & current)
- **Placement Status**: 5 states (OPTED_IN, OPTED_OUT, HIGHER_STUDIES, PLACED, PLACED_FINAL)
- **Placement Eligibility**: `canSitForMore` flag with 2x CTC rule for students placed ‚â§6L

### 2. StudentPlacement Model
- Tracks all placement offers received by each student
- Links students to jobs
- Tracks offer status (PENDING/ACCEPTED/REJECTED)
- Stores CTC, stipend, job type, offer date, and notes

### 3. Placement Eligibility Rule
**Business Logic**:
- If a student is placed with **CTC ‚â§ 6 LPA**, they can continue sitting for companies offering **‚â§ 2x their current CTC**
- Once student accepts an offer with CTC > 6 LPA or offers > 2x their current, they become `PLACED_FINAL` and cannot sit for more companies

## üõ†Ô∏è Import Scripts

### Student Import
```bash
pnpm import-students "raw_data/[filename].csv"
```

**Features**:
- Auto-detects header row (skips institutional headers like "Shiv Nadar University Chennai")

- Parses batch from roll number (22110172 ‚Üí 2022-2026)
- Handles missing/null CGPA and arrears gracefully
- Prevents duplicates (checks rollNumber uniqueness)

### SSN Job Import
```bash
pnpm import-ssn-jobs
```

**Features**:
- Filters for "SNU Included" and "SNU Company" only
- Auto-maps job types (Intern + Full Time ‚Üí INTERN_PLUS_FTE)
- Auto-assigns category based on CTC (MARQUE/SUPER_DREAM/DREAM/OTHER/REGULAR)
- Smart date parsing

### Verification Script
```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/count-students.ts
```

Displays total student count and breakdown by department/section.

## üîó Quick Access

**View all data in Prisma Studio**:
```bash
pnpm db:studio
```

**Re-run imports** (if needed):
```bash
# Import all students again
pnpm import-students "raw_data/BTech AIDS (A) 2026 batch(BTech AIDS (A) 2026 batch).csv"
pnpm import-students "raw_data/BTech AIDS (B) 2026 batch 1(BTech AIDS (B) 2026 batch).csv"
pnpm import-students "raw_data/BTech CSE Cyber Security 2026 batch(BTech CSE (CS) 2026 batch).csv"
pnpm import-students "raw_data/BTech CSE IoT (A) 2026 batch(BTech CSE IoT (A) 2026 batch).csv"
pnpm import-students "raw_data/BTech CSE IoT (B) 2026 batch(BTech CSE IoT (B) 2026 batch).csv"

# Import jobs
pnpm import-ssn-jobs
```

**Note**: The import scripts check for duplicate roll numbers, so re-running will skip already imported students.
