3. **Choose implementation option**: Full / MVP / Gradual
4. **Start implementing components**: I'll help with each phase!

## ❓ **Questions to Answer**

Before proceeding, please answer:

1. **Student Data**: Do you want to add Student model for:
   - Eligibility checking?
   - Application tracking?
   - Placement statistics (avg CTC by student percentile)?

2. **Implementation Speed**: Which option do you prefer?
   - Option 1: Full implementation (all Haveloc features)
   - Option 2: MVP (core features only)
   - Option 3: Gradual rollout (one feature at a time)

3. **File Uploads**: Where should job attachments be stored?
   - Local filesystem
   - Cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, etc.)
   - Database (base64 encoded - not recommended for large files)

4. **Historical Data**: Do you have historical placement data for "Highest Paid Ever"?
   - If yes, what format?
   - If no, should we track going forward only?

Let me know your preferences and I'll implement accordingly! 🚀
