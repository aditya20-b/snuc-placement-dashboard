# Student Model & Data Import Summary

## üéØ Overview

Successfully created a comprehensive Student management system with placement tracking capabilities.

## üìä Database Schema Updates

### New Models Added

#### 1. **Student Model**
Tracks student information, academic details, and placement status.

```prisma
model Student {
  // Personal Information
  name, rollNumber (unique), email, mobile

  // Academic Details
  department, batch, section, cgpa
  historyOfArrears, currentArrears

  // Placement Status
  placementStatus: OPTED_IN | OPTED_OUT | HIGHER_STUDIES | PLACED | PLACED_FINAL
  canSitForMore: boolean

  // Current/Final Placement
  finalPlacedCompany, finalPlacedJobTitle, finalPlacedCTC, finalPlacedJobType, finalPlacedDate

  // Relations
  placements: StudentPlacement[]
}
```

#### 2. **StudentPlacement Model**
Tracks all placement offers received by students (allows tracking multiple offers).

```prisma
model StudentPlacement {
  studentId, jobId
  company, jobTitle, ctc, stipend, jobType
  offerDate, offerStatus (PENDING/ACCEPTED/REJECTED)
  isAccepted: boolean
  notes
}
```

#### 3. **PlacementStatus Enum**
- `OPTED_IN`: Student is participating in placements
- `OPTED_OUT`: Student is not participating
- `HIGHER_STUDIES`: Student opted for higher studies
- `PLACED`: Student placed (can sit for <=2x CTC if current CTC <=6L)
- `PLACED_FINAL`: Student placed and not eligible for more

### Placement Eligibility Rule

**Important Business Logic**:
- If student is placed with CTC **‚â§ 6 LPA**, they can sit for companies offering **‚â§ 2x their current CTC**
- Field `canSitForMore` tracks this eligibility
- When CTC > 6 LPA or student accepts an offer > 2x, status becomes `PLACED_FINAL`
