I'll create a bulk import script for you.

### Usage:

1. **Prepare your CSV files** following the templates above
2. **Place them in a `data/` folder** in the project root
3. **Run the import script:**
   ```bash
   pnpm import-jobs data/jobs.csv
   pnpm import-events data/events.csv
   ```

## üìù Notes on Student Data

Your student data (name, email, class, phoneno, cgpa) is valuable but we don't currently have a `Student` model in the database. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Add Student Model (Recommended for Full Tracking)
If you want to track which students applied to which jobs, you'll need:
- Add `Student` model to Prisma schema
- Add `Application` model to track student-job relationships
- This enables features like:
  - "Who applied to Amazon?"
  - "What's the average CGPA of placed students?"
  - Student-specific dashboards

### Option 2: Use Tracker with LocalStorage (Current Implementation)
- Students track their own applications locally
- No need to modify database
- Privacy-friendly (no central tracking)

### Option 3: Store Student CSV for Reference Only
- Keep student data in a separate file
- Use it for eligibility checks manually
- No database changes needed

**Would you like me to add a Student model and tracking system?**

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Prepare `jobs.csv`** with your 5 current job postings (and any others)
2. **Prepare `events.csv`** with campus visit dates and application deadlines
3. **Run import scripts** (I'll create these next)
4. **Test the dashboard** to see jobs and events populated
5. **Decide on student tracking** (do you want Option 1, 2, or 3 above?)

Let me know which data files you'd like to prepare first, and I can help format them correctly!
