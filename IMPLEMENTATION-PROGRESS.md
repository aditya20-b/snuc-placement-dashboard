## üí° **Known Issues & Limitations**

### **Minor Issues:**
1. Dashboard stats fetch shows ECONNREFUSED on port 3000 when server runs on 3001
   - **Impact**: Low (pre-existing issue)
   - **Fix**: Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in `.env.local` to match actual port

2. File attachments stored as base64 in database
   - **Impact**: Medium (5MB limit per file)
   - **Recommendation**: For production with large files, migrate to S3/Cloudflare R2

3. No student profiles yet
   - **Impact**: Medium (limits personalization features)
   - **Workaround**: All jobs shown to all students

### **Performance Optimizations Done:**
‚úÖ Exclude fileData from job list responses
‚úÖ Limit logs to last 50 entries
‚úÖ Indexed queries for common filters
‚úÖ Aggregate counts for attachments/notices
